>Dataset:Kaggle
age: Age of the patient

sex: Sex of the patient

cp: Chest pain type, 0 = Typical Angina, 1 = Atypical Angina, 2 = Non-anginal Pain, 3 = Asymptomatic

trtbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

chol: Cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor

fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl), 1 = True, 0 = False

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results, 0 = Normal, 1 = ST-T wave normality, 2 = Left ventricular hypertrophy
>Conclusion
Most of the models are performing really well.
SVM is performing the best for the given dataset.
